# semantic-search-prototype

Prototype for a search engine backend as described in my thesis.

The model to be used needs to be added in a folder called `model` to use this code.

Also the JSONL files of the PubMed articles also need to be added and the path needs to be inserted into `pg_call_query_db.py`.
